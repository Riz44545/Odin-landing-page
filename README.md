# Odin Landing Page - Foundations course

This is just an example of basic css landing page layout done with flexbox. 

However, this is not responsive, and it's just spaghetti css code. The Css written here is not organized at all. Css is not one of my strong suits and i'm hopefully trying to improve that. 

This works well above 1200px screen width, aka laptop and desktop view.
